# MapReduce-Barrier-OS-Exercise

This project implements a multithreaded MapReduce framework in C++. It uses a

Barrier

 from

Barrier.cpp

 to synchronize threads during different stages of the MapReduce process, which is implemented in

MapReduceFramework.cpp

. A

Makefile

 is included for easy compilation.

## Building

```sh
make
```

This will compile the source files and produce the static library `libMapReduceFramework.a`.

## Files

-

Barrier.cpp

: Implementation of a reusable barrier using pthreads.
-

Barrier.h

: Header file defining the Barrier class.
-

MapReduceFramework.cpp

: Core logic for multithreaded MapReduce processing.
-

Makefile

: Build script for compiling and archiving the library.

## Usage

After building, link `libMapReduceFramework.a` with your own C++ program that includes the MapReduce logic. For example:

```cpp
#include "MapReduceFramework.h"

// Your main or other entry points here
int main() {
  // Prepare input and output vectors, then call startMapReduceJob()
  // ...
  return 0;
}
```
